# SPACES - Seat Reservation Android App


## About The Project

The Spaces app is an intuitive way of finding available spaces to study or work and cut down the time required to find a place to use in a venue. Start-ups or 
existing companies have the opportunity to implement basic booking systems into their spaces for organised usage by visitors. It allows for easier 
implementation than developing their own bespoke systems or update for less efficient systems.
